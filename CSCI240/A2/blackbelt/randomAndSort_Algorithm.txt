randomAndSort Algorithm
Pawas Aggarwal

Goals:
Generate a random array of integers and use bubble sort to sort it.

Input:
Not Applicable

Output:
Print a sorted array.

Steps:

initialize array with constant length

create function to generate random integers and put in array
randomGen()
  initialize for loop to go until length of array
  generate random integer using rand() function
  put the random integer in array at sentry variable value

create function to print values inside the array
printValues()
  initialize for loop to go until the length of array.
  print element according to the value of sentry variable of for loop

create function to swap values at two different adresses
swap(firstVal, secondVal)
  initialize temporary variable with value of firstVal
  change value of firstVal to secondVal
  change value of secondVal to value of temporary variable

create function to sort the array using bubble sort
sort()
  initialize first for loop with i at 0 and add 1 until it reaches length of array
  initialize second for loop with j at 0 and add 1 until it reaches 1 less than lenght of the array
  check if the value in array at j is larger than the value at j+1
    if true, call swap and pass the values at j and j+1 as parameters
    print array by calling printValues()
create main function to run the program
main()
  print values in array before sorting
  call sort() function to sort the array
  print values in array after sorting
  end function
