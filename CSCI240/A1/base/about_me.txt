Hello, I am Pawas Agggarwal. I am doing Computer Science and I am a second-semester freshman right now. I have learnt programming in Python and SQL. I took CSCI 230 last semester and thus this is the next class for my degree. I like to play guitar and video games. I tend to understand algorithms and programming easily. I hope to become a successful computer scientist and have my own startup. I am from New Delhi, India.
