insertionSort Algorithm
Pawas Aggarwal

Goals:
Implement insertion sort using pointers in C.

Input:
Not Applicable

Output:
Print a sorted array.

Steps:

initialize array with elements in unsorted order.

create function to print values inside the array
printValues()
  initialize for loop to go until the length of array.
  print element according to the value of sentry variable of for loop

create function to sort the array using insertion sort
sort()
  initialize for loop with i at 1 and add 1 until it reaches length of array
  initialize variable temp with value in array at i
  initialize variable j with value i-1
  initialize while loop and continue until j is more than equal to zero and 
            value in array at j is more than value of temp.
            change value in array at j+1 to values in array at j
            subtract 1 from value of j
  change value in array at j+1 to value of temporary

create main function to run the program
main()
  print values in array before sorting
  call sort() function to sort the array
  print values in array after sorting
  end function
